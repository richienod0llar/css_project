                <h2>How this project was built</h2>
                <p class="lead">I started with the Vogue Runway image dataset, cleaned and merged the metadata, and then extracted color features from each photo.</p>
                <p>Each image was resized for efficient processing, clustered in LAB color space to find dominant colors, and matched to Sanzo Wada palettes using ΔE 2000. I then aggregated trends by year, decade, designer, and season to quantify shifts in lightness, saturation, and palette diversity.</p>
                <p>Finally, I translated those results into interactive D3 visualizations and scrollytelling sections, and built this site to connect the analysis to the story of fashion’s chromatic evolution.</p>

                <h2>What do 30,000 runway photos from top brands reveal about fashion?</h2>
                <p class="lead">Over nearly four decades, from 1988 to 2023, fashion underwent a dramatic transformation. Not in silhouettes. Not in hemlines. But in something more subtle, yet profound: <strong>color</strong>.</p>
                <p>This is an analysis of 30,000 images from Vogue Runway, spanning 1,549 designers across 36 years, using perceptually accurate color science from Sanzo Wada's 1933 "Dictionary of Color Combinations" to map the evolution of fashion's chromatic mood.</p>

                <h2>Color shifts after the Cold War</h2>
                <p class="lead">The largest chromatic jump—from the saturated, neon-heavy 1980s into the muted ’90s—lines up with a seismic political reset. The fall of the Berlin Wall (1989), German reunification, and the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) opened fashion to a more global, minimalist sensibility. Designers traded bold, ideological statements for quieter palettes that resonated with this newfound international optimism.</p>
                <p>By the end of the 1990s, color distance was still high because collections were continuing to rethink identity as globalization accelerated. After the trauma of 2001 and the ensuing cultural uncertainty, the runway shifted darker and denser, with mean lightness falling from ~130 in 2000 to ~115 just a year later while saturation climbed—reflecting a post-9/11, post-industrial mood that was more defensive than celebratory.</p>

                <p class="lead">Fashion moves in cycles, but the current era of <strong>light, desaturated, neutral</strong> palettes has shown remarkable staying power.</p>
                <p>This isn't just a trend that will cycle out in a few years. It's a fundamental shift in how luxury presents itself.</p>
                <p>From the bold, saturated colors of the 1980s to the "quiet luxury" of today, fashion's chromatic evolution mirrors broader cultural shifts toward restraint, sophistication, and understated wealth.</p>
