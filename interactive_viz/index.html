                <h2>How this project was built</h2>
                <p class="lead">This project exists to make a long, qualitative debate about fashion’s “mood” measurable. By quantifying color across decades of runway imagery, we can test whether cultural narratives (like minimalism after the early 1990s) show up in the data.</p>
                <p>Started with the <a href="https://archive.org/details/VogueRunway_dataset">Vogue Runway image dataset</a>, a separate metadata table was created with 3 datasets cleaned, de-duplicated and merged together so every photo had a year, season, designer, and collection type. Images were resized to 256×256 to standardize sampling and reduce compute without losing palette structure.</p>
                <p>The core algorithm extracts dominant colors using K-Means (k=6) in LAB color space, which aligns with human perception better than RGB. For each image, the cluster centers become its palette; lightness (L*), chroma, and color diversity (cluster spread) are computed to capture both intensity and variety.</p>
                <p>To compare across years, each image is matched to one of 37 <a href="https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io/">Sanzo Wada</a> palettes</a>. The match uses ΔE 2000 <a href="https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/gsharma/papers/CIEDE2000CRNAFeb05.pdf">(CIEDE2000)</a> to find the closest palette by perceptual distance, creating a consistent “vocabulary” of colors for time-series analysis.</p>
                <p>Finally, these metrics are aggregated by year, decade, designer, and season, validate the trends for outliers, and translate the results into D3 visualizations.</p>

                <h2>What do 30,000 runway photos from top brands reveal about fashion?</h2>
                <p class="lead">Over nearly four decades, from 1988 to 2023, fashion underwent a dramatic transformation. Not in silhouettes. Not in hemlines. But in something more subtle, yet profound: <strong>color</strong>.</p>
                <p>This is an analysis of 30,000 images from Vogue Runway, spanning 1,549 designers across 36 years, using perceptually accurate color science from Sanzo Wada's 1933 "Dictionary of Color Combinations" to map the evolution of fashion's chromatic mood.</p>

                <h2>Color shifts after the Cold War</h2>
                <p class="lead">The largest chromatic jump, from the saturated, neon-heavy 1980s into the muted ’90s, lines up with a seismic political reset. The fall of the Berlin Wall (1989), German reunification, and the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) opened fashion to a more global, minimalist sensibility. Designers traded bold, ideological statements for quieter palettes that resonated with this newfound international optimism.</p>
                <p>By the end of the 1990s, color distance remained elevated as collections rethought identity for an integrated world; the 4.44/3.27 swings show designers still searching for a new narrative. After 2001 the runway shifted darker and denser, with mean lightness falling from ~130 to ~115 in a single year while saturation climbed, capturing a post-9/11, post-industrial mood that felt defensive rather than celebratory.</p>
                <p>Post-2005 the data finally settle: ΔE drops to 1.24 and then 0.54, and annual lightness/saturation hover around ~132 and ~11. That plateau correlates with the rise of “quiet luxury,” sustainability mandates, and digital-first retail, which encouraged designers to keep palettes restrained and consistent instead of chasing dramatic swings.</p>

                <p>This isn't just a trend that will cycle out in a few years. It's a fundamental shift in how luxury presents itself.</p>
                <p>From the bold, saturated colors of the 1980s to the "quiet luxury" of today, fashion's chromatic evolution mirrors broader cultural shifts toward restraint, sophistication, and understated wealth.</p>
